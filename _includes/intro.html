<h3>
    Climate change, overfishing, bycatch, and plastic pollution all threaten marine life and are driving many populations down. Some scientists think we are facing a sixth extinction event; there have been five other massive ones in the Earth's history. An estimated 90% of large marine predators have disappeared in recent decades. Marine mammals in every ocean are threatened.
